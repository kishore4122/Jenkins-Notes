Repository
  Arepository is a storage location where components such as packages,
  libraries,binaries,or containers are retrieved so they can be installed
  or used.
  
  In order to ease consumption and usage of open source components,they
  are aggregated into collections on public repositories,and are typically
  available on the internet asaservice.
  
  Examples of such repositories are:
     Central Repository,also known as Maven Central
     NuGet Gallery
     RubyGems.org
     npmjs.org
     Dockerhub

	Repository Manager
		A repository manager isadedicated server application used to manage all
		the repositories your development teams use throughout the course of
		development.
		At its core,arepository manager does the following:

		1. Store and retrieve build artifacts.
		2. Proxies remote repositories and caches contents.
		3. Hosts internal repositories.
		4. Groups repositories intoasingle repository.
		5. Enable greater collaboration between developers.
		6. Bring increased build performance due toawider distribution of
			software and locally available parts.
		7. Reduce network bandwidth and dependency on remote repositories.
		8. Insulate your company from outages in the internet,outages of public
			repositories(Maven Central,npm,etc.)

Nexus
Versions
  Nexus is available as commercial and Open Source distribution.
	Nexus OSS is the open source version of the Nexus Repository Manager.It
	enables open source components from public repositories to be cached
	internally as well as the hosting of software components developed in
	house.
	Nexus Pro extends the Nexus OSS features to include build promotion,
	staging support and extensive authentication and authorization functions.
	Nexus Pro also offers meta data management as well as support for
	distributed teams and high availability functionality.
	
Type of repositories: 
	1. Hosted Repository
		This is the one that you host on your server through third party softwares like Nexus.
		It hosts any private libraries and artifacts of your organization that shouldn't be public for security reasons.
		By default,the repository manager ships with the following configured
		hosted repositories:
		maven-releases:This hosted repository uses the maven2 repository format witharelease version policy.It's intended to be the
			repository where your organization publishes internal releases.
		maven-snapshots:This hosted repository uses the maven2 repository format withasnapshot version policy.It's intended to be the
			repository where your organization publishes internal development versions,also known as snapshots like 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
			nuget-hosted
	2. Proxy Repository
		Aproxy repository is a repository that is linked toaremote repository.
		Any request foracomponent is verified against the local content of the proxy repository.
		If no local component is found,the request is forwarded to the remote repository.
		The component is then retrieved and stored.locally in the repository manager,which acts as a cache.
		Subsequent requests for the same component are	then fulfilled from the local storage, therefore eliminating the network bandwidth and time overhead of retrieving the component from the remote repository again.
		Ex:maven-central,npm,Docker,PyPI,yum
	3. Group Repository
		A repository group isacollection of other repositories,where you can combine multiple repositories of the same format intoasingle item.
		Using this we can haveasingle URL for proxy and hosted repositories.
